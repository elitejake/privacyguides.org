  **KeePassXC** is a community fork of KeePassX, a native cross-platform port of KeePass Password Safe, with the goal to extend and improve it with new features and bugfixes to provide a feature-rich, fully cross-platform and modern open-source password manager.

  ## Notes
  KeepassXC stores its export data as [comma-separated values (CSV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values). This may mean data loss if you import this file into another password manager. We advise you check each record manually.
