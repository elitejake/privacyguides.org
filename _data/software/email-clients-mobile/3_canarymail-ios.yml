  Canary Mail is a paid email client designed to make end-to-end encryption seamless with security features such as a biometric app lock.

  ## Notes
  Canary Mail is closed source, however on iOS there aren't any other viable options for an email client which supports OpenPGP.

  Canary Mail only recently released a Windows and Android client we don't believe they are as stable as their iOS and Mac counterparts.
