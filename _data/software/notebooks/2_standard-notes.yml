  **Standard Notes** is a simple and private notes app that makes your notes easy and available everywhere you are. It features end-to-end encryption on every platform, and a powerful desktop experience with themes and custom editors. It has also been [independently audited (PDF)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/standard-notes/security/Report-SN-Audit.pdf).

  Joplin does not support password/pin protection for the [application itself or individual notes/notebooks](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/289). Data is still encrypted in transit and at the sync location using your master key.
