  **LUKS** is the default full disk encryption method for Linux. It can be used to encrypt full volumes, partitions, or create encrypted containers.

  ## Creating encrypted containers
  <pre class=terminal>
  dd if=/dev/urandom of=/path-to-file bs=1M count=1024 status=progress
  sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /path-to-file
  </pre>

  ## Opening encrypted containers
  We recommend opening containers and volumes with `udisksctl` as this uses [Polkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polkit). Most file managers, such as those included with popular desktop environments, can now unlock encrypted files. Tools like [udiskie](https://github.com/coldfix/udiskie) can run in the system tray and provide a helpful user interface.

  <pre class=terminal>
  udisksctl loop-setup -f /path-to-file
  udisksctl unlock -b /dev/loop0
  </pre>

  ## Backup of volume headers
  We recommend you always [backup your LUKS headers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Device_encryption#Backup_and_restore) in case of partial drive failure. This can be done with:

  <pre class=terminal>
  cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/device --header-backup-file /mnt/backup/file.img
  </pre>
