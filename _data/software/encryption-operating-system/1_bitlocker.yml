  **Bitlocker** is the default full volume encryption that comes with Microsoft Windows. The main reason we recommend it is because of its [use of TPM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/how-windows-uses-the-tpm). [Elcomsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElcomSoft), a forensics company, has written about it: [Understanding BitLocker TPM Protection](https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2021/01/understanding-bitlocker-tpm-protection/).
